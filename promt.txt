I have some videos regarding NLP from which subtitles are extracted.
Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in second, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
[{"title":"Introduction And Roadmap To Natural Language Processing And","number":"2","start":3464.74,"end":3469.46,"text":" session whatever I have taught you today that session will be there again understand the first winner"},{"title":"Bag Of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec NLP And","number":"3","start":5891.28,"end":5894.28,"text":" if i come first i will also get prize i guess"},{"title":"Introduction And Roadmap To Natural Language Processing And","number":"2","start":2358.34,"end":2364.66,"text":" okay credit card worth something and you have the winner something so obviously here in this particular"},{"title":"Introduction And Roadmap To Natural Language Processing And","number":"2","start":3469.46,"end":3475.3,"text":" will get 2000 rupees the second winner will get 1500 and third winner will get 1500 okay so please make"},{"title":"Introduction And Roadmap To Natural Language Processing And","number":"2","start":3433.22,"end":3439.14,"text":" is given in the pinned comment because after you win the prize you know then I will be able to send"}]

is there any giveaway in this course?
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer where an how much content is taught where (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video
If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course.
