    "text": " hello guys am i audible i'm live i guess i hope you are doing fine please do give me a confirmation if you are able to hear me out and yes so we are going to just start the live session in some time till then let's have some chit chat and let's see whether you are able to hear me out i hope everybody is able to hear me out right yeah so yes today we are going to start the nlp series and so just give me a confirmation if you are able to hear me i think i can hear my voice too from my youtube channel itself so do hit like because this is going to be an amazing series of nlp where i'm going to cover machine learning and deep learning and apart from that today i'm also going to give you 5000 rupees you know so by making sure that there will be a simple quiz in hand and if you really want to participate in the quiz uh make like i will start the quiz after i probably complete the session and after that once we complete the quiz i will distribute you somewhere around 5000 rupees uh all you have to do is that make sure that you follow me on instagram and whoever wins you know at the end of the day they can communicate me through the instagram and i'll give you the money live through my google pay or phone pay you can actually give whatever information you want okay so today we are going to have a quiz and we'll select three prices i guess um let's make it like first price will be 2000 second price will be 2000 and third price will be 1000 rupees okay so we'll do it like that and uh uh the nlp plan the agenda will be in such a way that we'll try to cover everything from basics and we'll make sure that you know uh we go till birth and transformers so there's just not a simple session or basic session that we are going to cover but instead we are going to cover in an amazing way so if you are new to this channel please make sure that you subscribe the channel and again uh to participate in the quiz after every session will uh i'll make a quiz so that everybody participates into it and one more thing that i really want to talk about is uh how the learning process will be uh what all topics we are going to cover every day i'll be talking about it so instagram you can see the pinned comment uh all the information is there just go ahead and click it or just go and search for krishnaic in instagram you'll be able to see that too okay so hello hello hello hello everyone yes so let's start and uh just give me another one minute i'll tell you the agenda okay and today we are going to have a very interesting quiz whatever i teach you that related quiz will actually happen okay it can be a little bit difficult uh but again it is up to you how many people are actually participating okay so without wasting any time let's go ahead and share my screen okay so yes i'm going to use this entire writing everything practical implementation i'm going to do like that so yes uh the day one of natural language processing okay so we are going to have this amazing okay and this is specifically for machine learning and deep learning can anybody tell me how many different types of community sessions we have actually taken from starting i think from january we initially started with stats then we went to machine learning then we went to deep learning i also did eda time series eda time series analysis and many more things okay so the agenda of this session will be number one okay we are going to basically see the road map of nlp and roadmap of natural language processing because if you follow this roadmap you will be able to easily crack any interviews okay so roadmap of nlp okay second thing is why nlp or i can also make this as my first point but we are going to understand this okay and then third uh today we are also going to see a lot a lot of examples a lot of examples a lot of examples okay a lot of examples a lot of examples real world scenarios and all uh and then we'll start with some basic things like uh something called as tokenization right tokenization and then we will understand two more words which is called as stemming and limitization okay and then finally the fifth topic we are going to see something called as bag of words okay so we'll try to cover up all these topics today um for the people who are asking me what is the prerequisite this okay bag of words is a technique which will actually help you to convert or just give some time i'll just let you know about bag of words okay so coming to the next thing is that what are the prerequisites in order to learn nlp okay so i'm going to basically say the prerequisites okay and why we have started like this everything will make sense okay so the prerequisites is that we are going to basically learn python okay we are going to learn python basically uh you need to know python sorry these are the prerequisites right so you need to know learn python you need to know python some amount of stats is required uh third at least some machine learning algorithms you need to know okay which i have already covered it through my community sessions fourth an and cnn idea you need to have not cnn cnn is also not required but at least an and with all the optimizers loss functions you should know it to know optimizers loss functions and all we like initially three to four sessions uh will we will be focusing on nlp related to machine learning but later on when we move into deep learning there we really need to know rnn and all lstm rnn gru okay and uh we will be seeing a lot of examples with respect to that uh we will be having um bi-directional lstm rnn and many more things okay so these are the some of the prerequisites and again all this has been covered in my community sessions i hope everybody agrees to that right so this is all completed in community sessions okay now after we complete all these topics then we are going to have an amazing quiz okay the quiz uh we will be giving 5000 rupees for the first price 2000 rupees inr okay for the second price 1000 rupees inr and the third price whoever is coming first top three i'll be giving them this much amount of money okay so in order to participate in the quiz uh and today only i'll give the money that basically means i'll be sending you to either google pay or something if people are from foreign countries i will send it through paypal okay so and uh for participating just go ahead and follow me in instagram okay because there only i'll be able to take your information okay so whoever will be coming first to second uh third uh you will be able to understand this okay so uh you just have to drop me a message if you come first so that i can validate you that you are the genuine person or not otherwise i'll be thinking that okay you made a new instagram account then and there and probably communicated me to just where to attend the quiz everything so i have already made the entire quiz over here so here you can basically see this entire quiz is there so that is almost ready uh we will start after once the session is completed okay uh sorry so okay fine i can make it to 1500 1500 because i want to distribute 5000 right sharp people huh so 1500 inr and 1500 inr okay so whoever participates in the quiz uh will do it okay so shall we start can i get a quick confirmation please uh make sure that you are in touch with me and please make sure that you watch this session till the end then only you'll be able to participate in the quiz in a proper way okay because whatever topics i'll be teaching you the same things will be coming in the quiz little bit difficult i'll make it okay so shall i start so please do hit like 643 people are watching let's make the like to 500 at least and then okay uh we'll start the session okay sir i don't have instagram id don't worry guys create an instagram id then it's very simple facebook account everybody has right so instagram becomes very easy so let's start okay now the first question that we are probably going to start is that why nlp okay so here we go why nlp why natural language processing okay now guys um if i hope everybody uses google right google every day you actually use right in google uh you search a lot of queries you try to see a lot of recommendations right so if i probably just open uh google news i'll be able to see so many recommendations that recommendation is based on your user profile right um like what the things you are serving so each and every information google actually captures that and based on that those kind of content recommendation is done in front of you okay so this google right it has like a lot of things that is used with respect to nlp that is natural language processing now i have already created a graph which looks which shows you the differences between ai versus ml versus dl right so suppose if i make this right this suppose is ai okay artificial intelligence what is the main aim of artificial intelligence is that you try to create an application which can do its task by itself without any human intervention so if i consider this as an ai let's consider that it is a universe okay at the end of the day we create an ai application now the second thing is that if i talk about machine learning machine learning is a subset of ai i hope i have i've drawn this diagram a lot times right in all my community sessions i usually draw this diagram because it is it is a very important thing right it is a very important thing that we learn these things right so that is the reason i draw this so let's say machine learning machine learning actually provides the stats tools to analyze the data explore the data do future forecasting do separate kind of predictions and many more things right and if i talk about the third part which is super super important that is deep learning so deep learning is another subset of ai okay sorry subset of machine learning so this i will say it as deep learning here the focus is that we create a multi-layered neural network right multi-layered neural network and this multi-layered neural network what we do is that we specifically uh try to make sure that the a machine learns like how we human being learn okay so it's it's it's just very simple we are trying to mimic the human brain right in the case of deep learning so these are the basic things now you may be thinking where does nlp come see let's say that at the end of the day okay okay i will just write nlp okay now where does nlp come can we learn nlp in machine learning can we learn nlp in deep learning this is the question right now one very simple thing is that nlp can be used both in machine learning and deep learning because nlp specifically says that here the data set that we are specifically dealing with is related to text right now understand you have a machine if you say that hey go and bring water right the machine will not just be able to do that specific task because machine language is completely different right the basic language for the machine to understand right it is it is completely different from the words or text that we usually give how we communicate with each other is completely different like how machine communicates with each other so you have to make sure that we provide or we convert that text or voice into a way into into a separate kind of data such that we specifically say vectors okay vectors so that we make the machine understand what exactly it is and machine in shorts understand binaries guys ones and zeros we have to give them numbers let's say vectors basically say that okay it is in the kind of a numerical format and based on that specific vectors only it will be able to understand okay so over here you can see that nlp can be used in both machine learning and it can also be used in deep learning why because over here specifically your data set is text now we need to create a such a model such in such a way that the model should be able to understand the text and based on this it should be giving us some output okay it should be giving some output now it may be text summarization it may be chatbot it may be uh you know what should be the next sentence that should be coming in a you know after a sentence let's say it can be different kind of task okay it can be a language translation right uh if i talk about google right google translator google translator is nothing but it is a machine translation what we say as a machine translation it is basically converting one language into another language so how that thing is actually possible again somewhere it will be using techniques from deep learning which i will probably be talking about so what entire on the sessions right we will try to focus on understanding the basics of how these words are converted to a vectors how the machine is able to understand text and how it is able to give you a specific output we'll try to understand both theoretically and practically okay so what is the demand of nlp engineers like recent research you know most of the phds you know people who are doing phds from mit stanford and all right they are literally working in this kind of theses and researches with respect to nlp because it has a huge scope you know one thing that i feel that is missing you know that is sarcasm you know i may say you that hey you are brilliant so this is a positive way of telling that you are brilliant okay so over here i am saying you know positive sarcasm way but if i say hey you are just brilliant you don't know anything like that so this is another sarcasm you know so the major challenge that is existing right now is that you know sarcasm the machine is not able to capture the sarcasm you know properly yes google is doing amazing amount of work but it will still take time you know it is going to take time and probably in the upcoming days you know the sarcasm thing is also getting captured nvidia has come up with an open source uh algorithm or uh open source model which can actually detect some amount of sarcasm and recently uh the github hackathon that we had in iniron you know one of the guy used that and he dubbed the entire voice right just imagine i'm talking english right they can now dub my voice and convert it into french spanish hindi bhojpuri uh telgu karnada or bengali or any kind of languages just imagine that powerful those models are right so wherever your text is data you know wherever your text is data at that point of time you specifically need to use nlp okay so this is what is the importance of nlp yet at the end of the day we are creating an ai application again understand now in this case the ai application may be a language translator or it can be a chat bot it can be a support chat bot and many more things right so this will be basically the entire uh you know why specifically nlp now if i come to why why because that point is still missing why nlp because we really want to make the machine because we want the machine to do our work right and how the machine will be able to do our work unless an idiot does not understand what we are trying to say right if it is not able to understand then obviously it will not be able to do your work so nowadays machine you know they are efficient in doing most of the automation task you know tomorrow you may be having robots that may be cleaning your house tomorrow you may be having machines will be cooking the food for you right and communication medium right how they can actually understand us how they can understand our sarcasm all those things will basically be required so i hope everybody is able to understand please give me a quick yes if yes please give me a super hot something like you know uh and we'll have this kind of fun more right now let's go ahead and let's talk about roadmap of nlp now what exactly is the specific roadmap okay so this roadmap i'll just draw it in the second sheet so here is my entire roadmap roadmap of nlp how do we basically start with nlp okay now the first step i will go from bottom to top approach okay i'm i'm just going to go from bottom to top approach now here you can see that let's say the first step you really need to know in machine learning in nlp specifically is called as text preprocessing text preprocessing now what exactly is text preprocessing see guys there are such scenarios and situation you know when we specifically get text data that may not be clean you know that may have that may be in the form of paragraph that may be in the form of sentences and in text preprocessing we should focus how we can convert this sentence or words into some format which we specifically say as vectors okay vectors basically means that it is it is a numerical format which we will be discussing as we go ahead and that numerical format when we feed it to the model it will be able to understand okay and it will try to find out okay what is the relationship between one word to the other word and based on that you can actually build a lot of applications like spam classification you know whether whether whether a comment is toxic or not and many more things even chat bots and many more right so here it is right now in text preprocessing initially we start with something called as basics like we have something called as bag of words we have something called as tfidf right we have something called as and they are very good amazing libraries which i'll be talking about and those libraries also i'll be mentioning about right so bag of words we have tfidf we have uh if i say word2vec word2vec is actually used both in machine learning and deep learning in deep learning we say it as embedding layers you know which is basically implementing so if i talk about this initial step is understanding the basic of um you know text preprocessing and if you understand the text preprocessing perfectly i think none no one can actually stop you and this basics is very much important whenever you are learning this text preprocessing text preprocessing in short says that how you can clean your data or convert into an efficient uh you know words or vectors how you can make sure that the machine will be able to understand things okay i would also instead of writing word2vec over here uh we will also be understanding about two more terms which is basically called as stop words you know why stop words is used we can also say it as something called a lemmatization you know so all these techniques we will try to learn in the basic things right and probably in today's class i will talk about some of the techniques that is actually required over here now coming to the second layer if you go one more step up which is super super important and this step uh i will say text preprocessing layer two okay so let me do one thing let me just rub this thing and make it in a better way so that you will be able to understand let's say in the text preprocessing one first step i will be showing you how you can do tokenization okay how you can do lemmatization oh today the handwriting is not that good not satisfied at all so i'm going to draw it again see unless until i'm not satisfied i'll keep on teaching you okay that is my that is my style okay so i'm going to make this okay so the first step as i said is nothing but text preprocessing and the text preprocessing one i have various steps like tokenization tokenization basically means that how we can convert a sentence into words right then we have something called as lemmatization okay we also have something called as stop words right we also have a technique which is called as stemming okay so all these things we'll see in the text preprocessing one but again understand here mostly we are cleaning the data here we are cleaning the data in such a way that at least when we give it to the model the model will definitely like those data okay so uh still we are discussing about the road back and there are a lot of things that are going to come up now coming to the second layer okay second layer is again text preprocessing but i would definitely say it as part two okay so here i have text preprocessing again and now in this text preprocessing part two i am going to focus on how i can convert the words into vectors so here i am going to basically have techniques like bag of words i'm going to have techniques like tfidf right here i'm going to have techniques like unigrams bigrams you know so here in short what we are doing is that we are converting the words into some kind of vectors okay uh but yes definitely there will be some problems with bag of words and tfidf which i am probably going to discuss as we go ahead since we are right now discussing about the roadmap now coming to the third step third step i would like to say this as uh there are some disadvantages with the text preprocessing that i've defined in the second step so this will be my third step of text preprocessing so in my third step of preprocessing here we will be learning techniques like gensim we'll be using amazing libraries like gensim and i'll not say gensim gensim is a library we'll be using techniques like word to vec we'll be using uh average word to vec you know i hope i i don't know whether you have heard this word or not but this word to vec and average word to vec is again a way of converting your words into vectors there are some problems with bag of words there are some problems with tfidf and the problems that exist over there we are going to remove it okay what is the disadvantage in bag of words and tfidf you are going to remove it with the help of word to vec and average word to vec okay so here uh you know we are going to learn an efficient way of converting a words into vectors okay so this is how we are actually going to go ahead with so this is my third text preprocessing technique and till here we go we will be having a good amount of vectors or good way of converting a word into vectors okay then after this we are also going to make sure that we solve some amazing problems in machine learning use cases then we will try to solve some good ml use cases the ml use cases can be spam classification it can be uh you know chatbot it can be text summarization to various different kind of use cases i'm going to take it and we are going to solve over here in ml use cases okay so still we are in ml right now still i have not moved in deep learning then uh after this what you are going to do is that now it is the time to move towards deep learning okay so i hope you can see this as a pyramid right your basics should get strong because if you are good at this then you will be able to learn this if you are good at this you will be able to learn this if you are good at this you will be able to learn this if you are good at this you'll be able to learn this so coming to the next thing is that we'll be learning about rnn we'll be learning about lstm rnn we'll be learning about gru right gru rnn so all these techniques we will try to learn and using these techniques now because here we are actually moving into deep learning okay here we are actually moving into deep learning and with the help of deep learning you will be able to create an efficient model specifically related to nlp use cases okay but it is always good that we know all these things also nowadays many people use this deep learning but this all things should be taught because your basics needs to be very very strong whenever you are implementing anything right tomorrow if you have a simple problem statement why you want to directly use deep learning and try to solve it right if you are getting a good accuracy with machine learning techniques and all these text preprocessing techniques that i have actually told you why you have to actually go above right so that is the thing that what we are trying to focus on so once you complete rnn and all understand for this i've already told you you have to have a prerequisite of ann loss function optimizers and all okay now we go to the advanced text preprocessing side so this advanced text preprocessing side here i will write advanced text preprocessing and here we will be starting to learn about amazing things like word embedding word embedding which is super super important okay for converting that this internally uses the technique of word to vec only but this is far more advanced when compared to the techniques that i have written over here there will be a lot of difference there you will be able to understand how the texts are actually handled in an efficient way okay so please make sure that i hope you are following all these things okay so word embeddings will be there which we will try to learn and now we will try to move to the advanced deep learning techniques which is called as bi-directional lstm bi-directional lstm we'll be having encoders decoders encoders decoders and this all will be actually helping us to even we'll try to create you know machine translation problem statements i'll do it practically in front of you then we will be having attention models right all these things we will try to learn so that is the reason i have not told you that only seven days i'll take nlpa this will go till 15 to 20 days that is what i feel if i'm able to cover every day one and a half or two two hour session and i'll not go much with it because again i don't want you all to take stress of so many things we'll go slowly we'll try to convert this into 15 days okay then we will be having we'll be learning about transformers we'll be learning about the final thing which is called as bot okay so this will be our pyramid of learning the learning process will be going from bottom to top okay and we will try to learn in this specific way now what are libraries we are going to cover one library for machine learning we're going to use nltk then we are going to use spacey one more library is something called as text block so with respect to machine learning we'll try to cover this three and and with respect to uh deep learning we will be covering tensorflow so using tensorflow if you want pytorch you can give me thousand likes i'll also teach you in pytorch because if i'm teaching i'll teach everything no but i need thousand likes okay if you give me thousand likes okay i i i will say okay this is confirmed this is confirmed okay both is confirmed otherwise i'll just teach tensorflow okay okay i'm kidding anyhow i'll teach you everything okay so all those things will be actually taught okay and uh so i hope everybody is clear with this everybody got it if you're able to understand please make sure that hit like share with all your friends tell them i'm going to teach all these things just in a span of 15 to 20 days right it will be quite amazing i'm really really happy that i took this task because i was trying to do it but again i was really busy you know uh but the energy level is always high i really want to teach you in the live session so that everybody understands these things right so yes uh we'll do it okay okay okay perfect uh so this is with respect to the roadmap i hope everybody understood this if yes make it thousand likes i'll also cover pytorch i promise okay okay done i know you it'll it'll be thousand likes i i think i have given you a simple task so this was about the roadmap of nlp now what i'm actually going to do i'm going to show you some of the examples uh again with respect to this we create a lot of applications with respect to nlp also like spam classification it can be chat bots right it can be text summarization it can be recommendation systems lot of things is there okay one thing okay i'm sorry i will also teach you hugging face we'll also use hugging face library okay and this will only be done when you hit 2000 likes okay so please do that okay so to 2000 likes i will also complete of hugging face okay so hugging face will also be completed don't worry i will this will be the best nlp playlist that you have probably seen okay let's go now this is done now let's go and see some of the examples and you tell me what example this is exactly okay so i hope everybody has seen google news okay if i click on google news do you see this kind of recommendations that are actually coming when you are okay forget about google news let's consider krish nayak if i search about krish nayak do you see many things over here on the right hand side you can see this this this this thing that you are probably seeing right okay uh this is from graph graph knowledge okay graph theory we basically say it's a graph knowledge that has been built up so you can see my name over here you know for all the information from all the social profiles that are just collected over here and you will be able to see the recommendation what all related keywords people are searching about you know they are also searching about my wife wikipedia salary age yeah my age i my age is 32 i don't have any shy to tell my age okay so here you can see all the information okay every information is basically that but understand one thing if i write if i click on images okay if i'm searching for krish nayak how this text is getting related to images i hope everybody has heard about dali too right dali too i guess everybody has heard about it uh you just write the text and it will automatically be converting to an image so that entirely thing is basically text to image conversion and that will basically be using nlp anyhow right so suppose i see that cat fighting with cat right cat fighting with cat you can see this images are there right images are there right and these are like not created images right it this is these are the images uh that you can basically see over here cat fighting it's it's a real image okay okay cat comedy cat if i search right how google is able to understand anyhow it is able to see see comedy cat cat memes see this how it is being able to show over here all the memes that are available in the internet you'll be able to see over here right and don't worry we'll do this problem statement also as we go ahead because i really want to teach you this time in an amazing way and i have not touched nlp from past many days so my interest is there i will do it okay no so if you say krish youtube okay krish youtube also you can see that first image is basically there okay krish nayak i have to add otherwise it is just giving every random krish krish nike youtube right so here you can see all the images right from my youtube channel right and it it can even link with other things you know it can also leave link with other things if i search about eye neuron intelligence right you can see this it will be linking with me do you see my face do you see sudhanush's face do you see hitesh face because anyhow it is being able to find out information right that are interlinked okay that are interlinked to each other right so that is how super important this is all and they're creating some amazing applications with respect to all these things right and it is super super important all the examples is in front of you right and see eye neural intelligence it has been linked with ash shandh ash shandh is the is the company who have funded us uh again thank you for ash shandh for trusting in us so that of trusting in our affordable courses and all right so here you can see artificial intelligence you can see data analytics you can see technology internship if i probably search for krishnike i may get other categories over here right i may get categories like twitter youtube missing values facebook feature engineering all these videos has been uploaded in my channel right so here you can see all these things is this amazing or not just imagine right so that is why i'm actually saying you that these all are something very super super important okay uh so i hope you have got all these things if i probably search in news also see news has been also been able to pick up my name right so i've just searched something this is like test to text recommendation i've given one text it has basically scanned from the entire graph knowledge of google and it is being able to see that from where where my name is actually linked right so with my company with with the things that we actually do everything has been linked and here you can see everywhere probably my photo is coming over here my photo is coming here here also uh probably the name is there you can see krishnike is there here also you can see the name is there right so everything this text to text recommendation also will be happening and there's all things you can actually do it with the help of lstm rnn only a bi-directional lstm rnn i'll show you everything we'll we'll try to uh do a lot of examples with respect to that okay so these are some of the examples with respect to this and uh you know dally to dally all these things are also available with respect to all this kind of things that we are doing okay so i hope everybody is clear with uh the roadmap so everybody is clear with the roadmap uh why nlp a lot of examples and tokenization you know bag of words sorry this part i will be taking now okay okay so super excited till here can i get a quick yes if everything is going on fine because after that i will be announcing about the quiz also it will be quite good right so let's go ahead now coming to the next topic let's start with something called as tokenization the first step of nlp that whenever you are starting to read is something called as tokenization okay not always understand guys if i consider a ml use case okay and let's say i am building a spam classifier okay spam classifier let's say gmail spam classifier or mail classifier spam classifier let's say okay okay so initially for this particular case what do you think our data set should be can i say my data set will be email body or it may be an email subject and my output that you will be seeing is either yes or no that basically means it is a spam or a ham we basically say spam or ham right spam or ham okay so i think this information is there right so i have this three features right so this is my feature one feature two so this is my feature one this is my feature two and this is my output which are my independent features over here the independent features that i can basically say independent features i can definitely say is nothing but email body and email subject okay so these two features you can see that okay i have an email body and email subject and based on these two features i need to predict whether the output data is spam or ham okay let's say my email body say that you won one million dollar okay you won one million dollar and the email subject is that billionaire let's say okay so in this particular case in this particular case what do you think the output will be it will basically be a spam okay this will be a spam let's say uh the other email that i could is that hey krish how are you hey krish how are you you so let's say this is my second statement this is my first data point second data point and subjects say that um subject basically i can write is that hello let's say over here definitely my output label will be ham ham ham basically is not a spam okay the third thing it will be that credit card you have one credit card okay credit card worth something and you have the winner something so obviously here in this particular case you'll say that this is a spam now think over it i cannot just give a machine okay i cannot just give a machine this kind of sentence and say that okay hey predict it how will the machine be able to understand this kind of words that is the main thing right now we need to do some steps the first step is basically tokenization the first step which we do is tokenization i will try to explain you what exactly is tokenization then the next step that we basically apply is something called as i can say stemming and before applying stemming also i can use something called as stop words i will talk about it okay then finally we apply something called as lemmatization okay so these are the three steps we specifically do the first step the second step along with stop words and the third step okay now i'll be explaining you about the first step that is called as tokenization okay so the first step is tokenization now tokenization is nothing but it is converting sentence into words everybody clear with this now sentence into words basically means what so here in my email body i have you won one million dollar right so this is the entire sentence okay so what we'll do is that we'll try to divide this into words now my words will be you won this will be one word second word and this will be third word and dollar will be fourth word right so here in tokenization what we focus on we focus on converting sentence into words because this words needs to be understandable by the machine learning algorithm or whatever algorithm you're trying to do so this is the first step of pre-processing as soon as i apply tokenization it is just going to take the sentence it is just going to take the sentence and convert it to words so this is the process of tokenization okay very simple very clear nothing so complex we are just taking the sentence converting into words now let's go towards something called as stop words okay let's say i have a sentence hey buddy hey buddy i want to go to your house okay let's say i have this sentence okay now in this particular sentence do you find some words like i i will not say i but at least i will say to to right there may be some words like off okay off and this kind of words you know may get repeated many number of times and if you want to remove this word because this words are not that important based on the output that we are going to get one word can be very important not right this word will be very important okay not or uh because i may say that i i like to uh i did go to the house i did not go to the house these two are opposite words right i did go to the house i did not go to the house so not keyword can play an important now but in the case of two of the he she this kind of words right is not that important for some of the use cases like spam classification or it can be uh important for some other use cases like uh text summarization you know and okay for text summarization it can be important but for some of the use cases this will not be important so what we do is that we can remove this words we can remove this words we will be applying something called stop words now you may be thinking can you can you have your own stop words the answer is yes you can also have your own stop words you can create a list of stop words and you can compare that how many words are actually present over here just to remove it okay but right now the library like nltk you know the stop words not is also present over there okay so if i want to really create my own stop words i will definitely not remove not i will create my own list like to the he see of go something small small words that you can see and i will probably create a list and i will make sure that i will not include not okay so this all i'm not giving that much meaningful information but yes we really need to remove this because some of the use cases like spam classification toxic classification you know in text summarization we may require to go and all but in other use cases we will not require it okay so that is the reason why we are specifically using stop words so this is also one specific process in text preprocessing and everything that we are learning over here it's something related to text preprocessing because at the end of the day i want to make sure that the machine will be understanding this text okay so this is the second step so in the second step what we did is that we removed this we removed the most small small small things in text preprocessing so here it is not a mismatch for the training bogus also using text preprocessing that it wants to be these parameters and the data on the same Freunde so you have<|ko|> in text preprocessing so this means we should go to base ideale finishedica as well and you should cultureize to each other which using a definition of\u68d2\u4e71shore system templatewear shortest ski balm in text text in text preprocessing so this actually flip\uc99d around okay setable to teach and Judean specific word or base stem of a specific word let me show you one example okay suppose I have two separate words like this historical and history okay now whenever I have this two words okay this two words represent different different things yes context wise I'll say that it represents something different word but the base and the stem are almost same right so if I apply on this specific word if I apply stemming on this word then this will get converted into history something like this okay it will be converted into H I S T O R I okay why and it is very simple we are trying to it is a process stemming is a process of reducing process of reducing words to their to their base word stem okay so this is my stem okay that is what we are doing but one disadvantage is that this word may not have any meaning not have any meaning this will definitely not have any meaning okay so I hope everybody is able to understand what is stemming right can I get a quick yes if you are able to understand till here yes yes I hope everybody is able to come so in short here what we are doing is that we are getting a root word very simple okay root word I may take one more example root word also you can say or you can also say something called as base form okay base words step base form but understand there are many words that can basically be used for defining things okay one more example that I can probably take for this is that let's let's consider one more simple word which is called as like we can definitely use something called as like this right this this word is also very important okay suppose I have three words which is called as finally which has called as final and which is called as something called as finalized now here you know that the context may be different but all has the same base base root right or base stem so this will actually if you apply stemming on this we it will get converted to something called as final okay why because see base is almost same final final final right and later on this all words it now again the meaning is gone right meaning is gone right so this is one some of the disadvantages with respect to stemming if I if I talk about one more simple example where stemming can really be helpful suppose I have a word which is like going okay goes and gone if I apply stemming to this three words I will basically be getting go so in this case I'm getting a meaningful word I'm getting a meaningful word right I'm getting definitely a meaningful word right so understand these things stemming can also be useful because it will be very very quick it is just trying to find out the base word and it is just trying to show you okay okay so I hope everybody is able to understand till here okay but now you know the disadvantage of stemming stemming is fast okay stemming is fast see advantages of stemming I'll say advantages of stemming stemming process is really fast is really fast it can actually help you for text pre-processing for huge data set okay but the disadvantage that I will talk about is that it is it is removing the meaning of the word is removing the meaning of the word okay it is removing the meaning of the word okay so this is the disadvantage now in order to overcome this disadvantages okay guys don't say that will come as final because I've tried this with the stemming purpose many people will be thinking final should come or not but I tried it out with the help of nltk library over there specifically final was coming so whatever things I'm showing you over here right I did it and then only I'm showing you now in order to overcome the disadvantage what we do is that we have something called as lemmatization so this will be my third fourth step uh fourth step which is called as lemmatization tomorrow we'll try to see the practical also so in lemmatization what we do is specifically in lemmatization now this is super super important in lemmatization we try to convert the word but here we will be getting meaningful word okay so when I probably give this to lemmatization in NLTK there is something called as word let word net lemmatizer so here I will be getting a meaningful word history okay and you may be thinking how it is able to do it has the entire dictionary of words it will probably check with respect to the base word and it will compare okay now if I also have a scenario which it says like finally finally final and finalized this will also get converted to a word which is called as final okay so that is how lemmatization work now over here advantage yes we are able to get a meaningful word meaningful word but disadvantage will be that it is slow right I hope everybody knows why it is slow because it has to really do a lot of comparison with respect to all the dictionary of what it has it is slow when compared to stemming now if I talk about some of the use cases if you say spam classification spam ham classification or toxic classification toxic basically means whether a person is basically writing a comment whether it should give three star one star five star like that right in that particular case also we can use stemming okay but lemmatization needs to be used in chatbots so if I say about use cases if I talk about use cases okay in case of stemming okay here I can say in spam classification I can use this in spam classification I can use stemming second one is that comments classification whether it is good bad or review classification I can write okay review classification review classification now based on this you can also give reviews on my lectures that I usually take okay so it may be good or bad it should not be bad no yeah I know many people have cleared the interviews you cannot say it is bad if if you say it is bad then you definitely require a phd person to teach you okay that is the thing now in case of lemmatization if I talk about some use cases because here meaningful words is important so I can basically use something like text summarization language translation okay language translation uh here I can also write third chatbots because chatbots also require good complete lemmatized words right so all this is super super important okay so it is definitely there and you can definitely check it out okay so okay perfect now yeah we can also avoid stemming and lemmatization that will try to learn it in a deep learning techniques but this is some basic things so overall if I talk about what is the first step that we basically do we do tokenization okay so in text preprocessing these are the steps we do first is tokenization the second step that we focus on is applying stop words the third step we can basically do stemming and the fourth step that we can actually do is lemmatization and sometime if you don't want to do stemming also you can skip that and can directly do lemmatization but again depends on the use cases uh this is amazing right because see if when you are able to understand when we should do this when we should do that you know so that actually uh comes out with amazing curiosity right and then you'll start questioning yourself okay this is amazing this is bad okay perfect uh yes uh now we have completed this I hope everybody is able to understand okay so here we have also completed this now after doing these steps after doing these steps I really want to convert this words into some vectors the next step I will say main step two step one is this right then step two means what we try to convert words into vectors now this is the step now here we have cleaned the entire text okay here we have cleaned the entire text and now we want to convert the word into vectors okay and that is what we are going to do it by different different techniques the first technique is something called as bag of words bag of words the second technique that we are going to learn is something called as tfidf then we'll understand what is the disadvantage with bag of words then we'll try to go towards tfidf then the third step that we are going to learn is about word2vec there are some disadvantages in tfidf so we definitely need to know about word2vec so that also we'll try to cover okay so everybody is happy so I think I thought you'll be making the likes to go thousand okay so word2vectors shall I start tomorrow uh or you want me to start today otherwise I can start the quiz okay can we do the step two from tomorrow if you want word2vec because that time we will try to understand about bag of words and tfidf but I think the introduction went well would you like to rate something out of 10 please go ahead you know tf basically term frequency inverse document frequency okay so this is basically called as term frequency and inverse document frequency frequency okay so this step we will try to take it tomorrow okay so let's go towards quiz uh what do you do I hope uh you like this session and uh we'll learn it and remember guys all these materials you know I will try to give it in the dashboard that is given in the description of this particular video enroll in this dashboard because there you'll also be able to find out the video link and all these materials will be given you is my handwriting good I like this diagram this diagram is the best diagram that I could ever draw just with my bare hands you know yeah I will be teaching attention models Dilip Kumar label to vector also I'll try to convert okay complete so quickly let's go towards quiz first of all everybody follow me in instagram follow me in
