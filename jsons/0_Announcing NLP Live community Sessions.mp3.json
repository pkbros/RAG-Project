Here I am not going to tell you that for how many days it will be going ahead, but here I will plan in such a way that I will start from basics NLP and it will be going on till we complete the entire NLP for both machine learning and deep learning. Now, with respect to the dates that we are planning to start, it will be from next week Tuesday, that is 14th June 2022. Every day I will be coming live at 7pm and we will be starting our NLP session from basics. I am going to cover many libraries like NLTK, Spacey in case of machine learning, then we will go to What2Vec, we will understand the libraries with respect to GenSim and then we will be moving towards RNN, LSTM, RNN, Bidirectional LSTM, RNN, then we will again cover Transformers and finally BERT and we will do a lot of practical sessions. So till now I have taken so many different kind of community sessions, let it be stats, machine learning, deep learning, you know, and people liked it. Even I have covered community sessions with respect to EDA. So my plan is again to make sure that the community learns in a proper way. So my suggestion will be that please make sure that you subscribe to the channel, press the bell notification icon so that whenever I go live from next week on Tuesday onwards, at every, basically every day at 7pm, you should be getting the notification from my side. Okay. Now the other thing is that all the materials related to this NLP sessions will be uploaded in the dashboard that will be given in the description of this particular video so that none of your materials gets missed. Even the video links will be put up over there as we will be conducting all the sessions. So I hope everybody attends those sessions.
